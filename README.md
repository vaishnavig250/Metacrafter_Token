# ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course
This course was designed about some basic concepts about Web3 and Blockchain with the solidity programming. 
I learnt various concepts through this course which i didn't know  earlier .
After Completed all three given modules i have to make a contract with the help of this concepts.

## The Course 
I wrote the code in Solidity Language with the help of Metacrafter Beginner EVM Course.


## The Challenge 

I have a challenge to create contract. In that I created a contract name as MyToken where token name as "noise" and token abbreviation as "go" along with its total supply. If I wants to mint some amount of noise tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also if I burns those tokens, it will get subtracted from the total supply (Only if there is enough balance).

### Operation 

* I used Online Remix IDE compiler for writing the solidity code Program with a version.
* I created a file which is in the repository named as vaish.sol for publishing that same code on GitHub.

### Running of Code 

* If you are using Remix IDE then you simply compile the code from the  menu. (As a advisory purpose)
* After compiling the code , you have to deploy the Contract from the bar/menu.
* And after deploying the code , you have to enter certain inputs. 

## Encourage I hope this helps!!!

I recommend this course to look at the Metacrafters academy for more such content. All the stuff it contains are great.
